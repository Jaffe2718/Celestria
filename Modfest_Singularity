		- can also be created using commands (for showcase - /celestria shooting_star %PLAYER% x z)
		- server sends packet to client which then renders the shooting star (mixin into WorldRenderer)
		- players get Minecraft's Luck effect

		- on start of night with full moon, players have an individual and configurable chance of receiving the 'Insomnia' effect
		- effect prevents players from entering a bed, instead sending a chat message to inform them about the reason
